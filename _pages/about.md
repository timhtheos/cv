## Me

Hi, my name is **Timothy**. My name derived from Greek words **Timh**, *honour or respect*, and **Theos**, *God*. Timhtheos, therefore and literally means, *honoring God*.

I am a devout Augustinian, a 5-point staunch Calvinist; and a trying hard, always reforming and intolerant Puritan; but by the Grace of God, I am what I am.  My deonominational afiliation though, is Reformed Baptist.

My hobbies include PHP, Linux, Bash, Drupal, CI, mixed with Theology, Law, Jurisprudence, among others.

I am currently working online as a Drupal Engineer/Developer, and the same time, I am a student of Reformed Theology.

## This Site

The primary purpose of this site shall be my personal wiki of some of the things that I did that I want to share. Also, this site shall be my experiment and practice to/of the following:

1. Code Driven Development (CDD)
  - *in Drupal* no database dump needed
  - I can destroy the site and rebuild a fully functional site from scratch with lots of build options

2. Site Automation
  - with mainly bash, php, and drush, and mixed with features
  - *with Continuous Integration (CI)*

3.  Module Development
  - yes, I am writing personal modules for my own satisfaction, during my spare time

4. Markdown (md)
  - I just want to master markdown which is very easy on constant use, so this site uses it, and I don't have fancy editors, in fact, I wrote and will write all contents of this site via an editor *vim*, and not from site admin */node/add/article*

### Other contents might be of the following topics:

1. Theology
  - yes, I love theology and *Theology Matters*
  - Currently, I hold the post as an admin of *Theology Mythbusters*. We vote and mark certain beliefs as a myth *i.e., busted*, plausible, or confirmed. Also, I pursue studies in Theology.

2. Politics
  - nevermind
  - I hate it, but it's everywhere, not just in government

3. Law
  - not an expert; just quotations
  - I am fond of reading Supreme Court decisions, and very curious as to how the minority defends their positions with their disenting opinions.
