I have been a slate user for years, and I am still amazed by this tool.

A colleague introduced me to slate. I used it for sole purpose of
switching windows in OSX.

I used it primarily and only for that reason.

Then, I started searching for some tools for tiling or some tiling window
manager. I learned about [Amethyst](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst).

I set it up on my local, and used it for a couple of days.

I removed it and move on for yet another search. Then came [KWM](https://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm)
tiling window manager. I set it up too, and used it for a couple of
months. I personally like it.

However, as time goes by, I had problems with the tiles being reset every
time I play dota.  The tiles reset in size and in order.  Not only that,
most keybindings disappear.  I had to reload kwmrc file every time this
happens.  I then finally decided to remove it.

At one point, at several weeks after I removed kwm, I tried re-installing
it again, but I was not able to fully set it up without errors.

I then again reviewed slate's documentation, and got [these line updates](https://github.com/timhtheos/dotfiles/commit/017f072353b1ab763f2092944d745b403314a5d1#diff-312ee6b77f05b59ee4f528c96e84b50eR30)
into my slate rc file.

Basically, it is this:

~~~
bind d:a,ctrl grid padding:5 0:6,3 1:8,2
~~~

1.  I bind `ctrl + a` then `d` to get to the grid.
2.  Then, I defined 2 monitors. 0 for the default monitor which is my
    macbook's monitor, and then 1 for the external monitor.
3.  Then, the `6:3` and `8:2` for the default and external monitors,
    respectively, are the grids.  6:3 means 6 grids horizontally by 3
    grids vertically.
4.  ATM, no definite idea yet as to the purpose of `padding:5`.

Slate is still amazing.
